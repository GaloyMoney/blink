# Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Galoy software.
These files not only contain information about Galoy itself, but also about running and developing GaloySI in general.

These documents range from guides to knowledge-base-esque information.
If you just want to get Galoy up and running, see the [README](../README.md).
