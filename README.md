## Local Development Setup

Running the Galoy software locally can be done in a variety of ways, but this abbreviated section will focus on a single method for
getting your environment ready to run the stack.
For more information and options on running Galoy locally, see the [development environment documentation](./docs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT.md).

### (1) Choose a Supported Platform

Currently developing on MacOS and Linux is supported.

### (2) Install Dependencies

Install dependencies on your chosen platform.

- **1)** [`nix` with flakes enabled](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer)
- **2)** `docker` from [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
- **3a)** [`direnv`](https://direnv.net) version `>= 2.30` installed
- **3b)** [`direnv` hooked into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html)

For `nix`, we highly recommend using the [Determinate Nix Installer](https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer).

For `docker`, the Docker Desktop version corresponding to your native architecture should be used.

For `direnv`, you can install it with [your package manager of choice](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html).
However, if you're unsure which installation method to use or your package manager does not provide a compatible version,
you can use `nix` itself (e.g. `nix profile install nixpkgs#direnv`).

> We recommend using [the upstream docs for hooking `direnv` into your shell](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html), but here is an example on how to do it
> on a system where `zsh` is the default shell.
> In this example, the following is added to the end of `~/.zshrc`.
>
> ```zsh
> if [ $(command -v direnv) ]; then
>    eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
> fi
> ```

### (3) Enter the Repository Directory

All commands need to be run from the `nix` environment.
Since `direnv` is installed _and_ hooked into your shell, you can `cd` into
the repository and `nix` will bootstrap the environment for you using the flake.

_Please note: you may notice a large download of dependencies when entering the repository for the first time._

### (4) Running the Stack

We use [**buck2**](https://github.com/facebook/buck2) to run the stack, run and build individual services and libraries, perform lints and tests, etc.

_Before continuing, you should stop any locally running services to avoid conflicting ports with the stack.
Some of the services that will run include, but are not limited to the following: PostgreSQL, OpenTelemetry, MongoDB.

Check if you are ready to run the stack before continuing.

```bash
buck2 run dev:healthcheck
```

You may notice some checks related to resource limits.
On macOS and in WSL2 in particular, we recommend significantly increasing the file descriptor limit for `buck2` to work as intended (e.g. `ulimit -n 10240`).
_Please note: the new file descriptor limit may not persist to future sessions._

Once ready, we can build relevant services and run the entire stack locally.

```bash
buck2 run dev:up
```

Once Tilt starts, you can check on the status of all services by accessing the UI through the given port on your local host (e.g. [http://localhost:10350/](http://localhost:10350/)).
Every service should eventually have a green checkmark next to them, which ensures that they are in "ready" states.

### (6) Troubleshooting in Tilt

If some services fail to start, you can restart them on the Tilt dashboard.

### (7) Tearing Down the Stack

The following command will stop all running services and containers.
It will also remove the containers and, consequentially, the data held in them.

```bash
buck2 run dev:down
```
