# From the Tilt docs:
#
# > By default, Tilt will not let you develop against a remote cluster.
#
# The implication appears to be that if Tilt finds a configured Kubernetes setup on your system
# **and** it's a remote cluster, despite the fact that we are not using any Kubernetes features or
# capabilities, it will still try to connect and fail. Instead, we're going to disable this check
# and continue.
